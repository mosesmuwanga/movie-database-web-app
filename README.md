# movie-database-web-app


The goal of this project was to create a web application similar to the Internet Movie Database. The application maintains a database of movie information, including things like the movie title, release year, writers, actors, etc. The site supports regular users, who are capable of browsing all of the information on the site and adding movie reviews, contributing users, who are able to add new people/movies and edit existing records.
